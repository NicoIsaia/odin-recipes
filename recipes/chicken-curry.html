        <h3>This easy staple chicken curry is a fantastic recipe for family dinners. 
            It's made with just a handful of ingredients and is enriched with creamy yogurt</h3>

        <p>Chicken curry is common to several countries including India, countries in Asia and the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>My favorite of them though is this aromatic Indian Chicken Curry, I'm always just craving these flavors.</p>
