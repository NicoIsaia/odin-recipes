        <h3>Bagna Cauda is an italian dip that is served very hot</h3>

        <p>This dip should be served over a heater to ensure that it always remains hot.</p>
        <p>You have to really like garlic to enjoy this. 
            I have heard that some people omit the cream and substitute olive oil also.</p>
        <p>Serve with crusty Italian bread, raw cabbage wedges, lettuce, bread sticks or crackers.</p>
